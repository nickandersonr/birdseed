                It was one of those events you don’t remember the beginning of, the journey to that exact place in your mind, but that once the feeling hits, it’s registered. Almost like you can hear the *click* of a recording device getting switched on in your brain:  *this is going to be a permanent memory. We’re recording it for future use.*
            </p>

                The recording starts like this: I’m sitting in front of a worn-grey CRT monitor in my high school computer lab. We’re supposed to be learning how to type, but I’m “surfing the internet”. Once again, I have no idea about the beginning. Did I go to Google (or more likely, Ask Jeeves) and type in “Weird Websites”? Had I clicked a banner ad or some stray affiliate link? No clue. The recording starts with me already there, a black background with Matrix-green text listing out links to lists of other links of “weird websites”.

                Among them were sites like [Ninja Burger](https://www.ninjaburger.com/), whose ominous order form had no address input as “we already know where you are”. I submitted my order and looked around nervously. Had I just ordered actual food from actual ninjas? Would they show up at my school, and would I have to pay them? At this point I had no idea how backend server architecture worked, how a form submission might connect to an SFTP action, or probably more importantly, what satire was. But the thrill was electric. Some one had made this, for no reason. The purest form of art and self-expression. They made this so that I would sit here and have this experience.

                Today I sit in front of two monitors that show me the same thing each day - a handful of webapps designed by, at most, 5 different companies.

                Who had assembled the list? Or the next list, or the list after it? Each site was assembled in 2001-era HTML and inline CSS. Each was handmade, with no clear allegiance to a style guide, brand, or operating system.
